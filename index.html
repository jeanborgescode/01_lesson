    <h2>Here you are going to find <em>everything</em>  you need to know about my journey as a Software engineer.</h2>
    <!--TODO: add weekly and after 4 weeks switch and combine by monthly-->
    <p>This is a record of my <strong>daily</strong>  learning process:
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - First week: CS50 + every other supplementary tutorial necessary;
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Second week: Practicing VSCODE + CODEWAR + HTML/CSS/JS. 
    </p>

    <h3>Hello World :)</h3>
    <p>Just in case you are missing that.
    <br>It seems to be a "important" step for Software Engineers.
